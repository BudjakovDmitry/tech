# Operators and expressions

A simple example of an _expressions_ is `2 + 3`. An expression can be broken down into
operators and operands.

_Operators_ are functionality that do something and can be represented by symbols such
as `+` ar by special keywords. Operators require some data to operate on and such data
is called _operands_. In this case, `2` and `3` are operands.

## Operators

### + (plus)

Adds two objects.

* `3 + 5` gives `8`
* `'a' + 'b'` gives `'ab'`

### == (equal to)

Compares if two objects are equal.

```python
x = 2
y = 2
x == y  # True

x = 'foo'
y = 'Foo'
x == y  # False

x = 'bar'
y = 'bar'
x == y  # True
```
