# AIOHTTP installation

```shell
pip install aiohttp
```

For speeding up DNS resolving by client API you may install `aiodns` as well. This
option is highly recommended.

```shell
pip install aiodns
```

The following will get you `aiohttp` along with `aiodns` and `Brotli` in one bundle.

```shell
pip install aiohttp[speedups]
```
