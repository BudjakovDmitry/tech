# TokenAuthentication

> Note that token authentication provided by Django REST framework is a fairly simple
> implementation.
> 
> For an implementation which allows more than one token per user, has some tighter
> security implementation details, and supports token expiry, see [Django REST knox](
> https://github.com/jazzband/django-rest-knox) third party package.
