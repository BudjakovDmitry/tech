# Introduction to Unix, Linux, GNU

## What is Unix?

Unix is the family of operating systems. The original Unix OS was created at AT&T Bell
Labs in the 1960s. However, like many operating systems at the time, it was made for a
specific hardware system, in this case, the PDP-7 computer. In the 1970s, the Unix OS
was rewritten in C, distinguishing itself from other systems and making it portable to
many hardware architectures. In the late 1970s UC Berkley developed Berkley Software
Distribution (or BSD) an add-on to Unix providing additional software and capabilities.
The famous macOS was derived from BSD.

Some popular Unix-based operating systems:

- Oracle Solaris (and Open Solaris)
- FreeBSD
- HP-UX
- IBM AIX
- Apple macOS

## What is Linux?

Linux is a family of Unix-like operating systems. Linux was developed as an effort to
create free, open source version of the Unix OS.

Features of Linux:

- free and open source
- secure
- multi-user: it is designed to support multiple users accessing the system
simultaneously;
- it is support multitasking: running multiple jobs and applications at the same time;
- it is portable: it has been ported to run on many different types of devices and
hardware platforms from desktops to servers to appliances.

## Linux beginnings

At 1980s at MIT was developed GNU project. GNU stands for "GNU's not Unix" and was made
as a free,  open source set of the existing Unix system tools. In 1991 Linus Torvalds
developed a free, open source version of the Unix kernel called Linux. The kernel is a
core component of an OS that enables components to communicate with machine's hardware.

In 1992 Linux operating system began to appear as unifying GNU and the Linux kernel.

## Linux distributions

Linux's distribution (distro) is a specific flavor of Linux OS. All Linux distributions
must use a Linux kernel. Kernel is a core component of the Linux operating system that
enables the system to properly use the computer's hardware.

Today there are a hundred of Linux distros. Each Linux distro includes a unique set of
default utilities that are part of the operating system, such as commands and
applications that come prepackaged with the distribution. Each distro supports a
specific set of commands that you can use in the shell, a window for entering and
receiving output from commands. Each distro has its GUI (graphical user interface). Each
distro provides differing level of support. It could be developed and managed as a
community-backed project or maintained by a commercial enterprise. And it could be a
long-term support version (LTS) or a rolling release, where stable package updates are
released on a rolling schedule.

Some popular distros:

- **Debian** is stable, reliable and fully open source. It supports many computer
architectures. Debian is highly regarded in the server space. It is the largest
community-run distro currently available.
- **Ubuntu**. Ubuntu is Debian-based, meaning that it is build on top of Debian and
uses a lot of the same tools as the Debian OS. It is developed and managed by Canonical.
- **Red Hat Linux** is a "core" Linux distro (like Debian), meaning that it is not
derived from another Linux distro. It is stable, reliable and fully open source. It
managed by Red Hat an IBM subsidiary. It ships as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), an
edition focused entirely on enterprise customers.
- **Fedora**. It's very reliable and secure, offering unique firewall and secure
features. It's sponsored by Red Hat.
- **SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE)**. It's available in two editions: server (SLES) and
Desktop (SLED). It's available in two editions: server (SLES) and Desktop (SLED).
- **Arch Linux**. This distro allows users to customize every part of their system
(do-it-yourself approach). This make it very configurable. But it means that you need a
strong understanding of Linux and system tools, in order to use Arch effectively. And
Arch isn't focused on the stability as other distros.
