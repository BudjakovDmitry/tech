# Shell and Terminal

## Shell

The Linux shell is an [OS-level](architecture.md) application that interprets commands.
In early versions of Unix and Linux the shell was the only way to interact with the
operating system.

## Terminal

### Tab completion

### Mice and focus

You can also use a mouse with your terminal emulator. It supports a quick copy-and-paste
technique. If you highlight some text by holding down the left mouse button and dragging
the mouse over it (or double-clicking a word), it is copied into a buffer. Pressing the
middle mouse button will cause the text to be pasted at the cursor location.

Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V don't work inside a terminal window. These control codes have
different meanings to the shell and were assigned many years before the release of
Microsoft Windows.
