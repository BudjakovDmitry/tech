# cd

Change current working directory.

```shell
cd path/to/dir
```

## Arguments

Path to a directory where need to go. If you run this command without arguments, you
will go to the user's home directory. So, commands `cd` and `cd ~` have the same result.

Change the working directory to the home directory of user_name: `cd ~user_name`.

Change the current directory back to the directory you were in previously: `cd -`.
