# cat

The `cat` command con**cat**enates and prints the contents of files.

In simplest way this command will read the contents of the file and print them out.

```shell
cat instructions.txt
```

If we provide cat with multiple files, it will concatenate their contents and output
them.

```shell
cat one.txt two.txt
```

## Options

### -n, --number

Number all output lines.
