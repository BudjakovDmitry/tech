# type

Print the type of command.

```shell
type clear
```

There are really four types of commands:

- An executable program, usually stored in `/bin`, `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`. These
are compiled binary files.
- A built-in shell command. These commands are part of the shell.
- A shell function.
- An alias.
