# cal, ncal

Display a simple calendar in traditional format.

ncal stands for "new cal". There is also a `cal` command that does the same exact thing,
but `ncal` adds some functionality.

## Arguments

If you pass a year in `cal` or `ncal` it will print out the calendar for that entire
year

```shell
cal 2019
ncal 2024
```

If we specify a month and a year, they will print out that month's calendar.

```shell
cal april 1927
ncal may 1990
```
