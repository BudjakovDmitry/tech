# file

Determine a file's type.

Filenames in Linux are not required to reflect a file's contents.

```shell
file book.pdf
book.pdf: PDF document, version 1.5
```

Command above will print brief description of the file's contents.

In fact, one of the common ideas in Unix-like operating systems such as Linux is that
"everything is a file".
