# The environment

The shell maintains a set of information during a shell session, known as __the
environment__. It's just a series of key-value pairs that define properties like:

- your home directory;
- your working directory;
- the name of your shell;
- the name of the logged-in user;

and these differ from one session to the next.

Use [printenv](/linux/terminal/commands/printenv.md) to print the environment variables.
