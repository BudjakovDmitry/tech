# POSIX

POSIX stands for "Portable Operating System Interface". It is a "family of standards"
or rather a collection of technical instruction manuals, created, maintained and
specified by the IEEE Computer Society, for creating and maintaining compatibility
between operating systems, specifically UNIX operating systems.

When something is POSIX complaint, it means that that thing, whatever it is, can work on
any UNIX or Linux operating systems. It is compatible across all Linux and Unix
operating systems.

POSIX has a set of automated tests. If you write them on your operating system, and they
all pass, your operating system is POSIX. These tests define rules for a standard
behaviour and interface, such as:

- Standard C operations;
- Multitasking;
- Error handling;
- Command line and commands;
